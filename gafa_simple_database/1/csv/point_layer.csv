UN Agencies","The Albertine Garben located in Albert Water Management Zone (AWMZ) in Uganda faces intensifying pressure on groundwater resources due to high industrial demand, particularly from the oil and gas sector and refugee hosting communities. While national studies and catchment plans affirm the zone’s groundwater potential, unregulated abstraction risks aquifer depletion, water stress, and community conflict. This project proposes an integrated, resilience-focused response to safeguard groundwater resources while expanding access to safe water for vulnerable communities.
The project will enhance recharge through the piloting of Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR) technologies—such as check dams, infiltration ponds, and recharge wells—in targeted catchments. Simultaneously, it will establish and expand groundwater monitoring networks to generate data critical for long-term water planning and abstraction control.
A key component will be the development of groundwater-based water supply systems in areas most affected by industrial extraction, ensuring that local populations directly benefit from resource investments. This will be supported by the rehabilitation of degraded catchments to boost recharge capacity.
The project also fosters public–private collaboration, especially with the oil and gas sector, to promote Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)-linked water security and recharge co-investments. Policy dialogue and institutional capacity-building on MAR and groundwater governance will ensure sustainability and local ownership.
Expected outcomes include increased safe water coverage, improved recharge and monitoring, reduced water-related conflict, and strengthened regulatory capacity.",Not required at this stage,"Water for Nature
